## Description

Running Zen is an ap for your TV that allows you to watch running videos while you exercise on your treadmill.

## Purpose

I wanted a native Apple TV app for doing this, rather than having to push from an iOS device.

## What Works

* Not much

## TODO

* Change videos to model
* Get videos to pull from VIMEO or YouTube or Firebase
* Create and upload running videos
* Figure out how to pull info from remote to adjust video speed


## Contributing

This will be a paid app on the app store, and I won't be able to pay anyone for updates you work on (at least not yet).  Contributes are still welcome.
